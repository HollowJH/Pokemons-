        <p>Pokemon mythology starts in a pretty similar way to most creation myths. In the dark nothingness of the void, an Egg appeared and hatched and thus Arceus was born. Arceus was the first being in the universe, and according to the Sinnoh legends, Arceus molded the rest of the universe after its birth. From there, Arceus created three more beings: Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina. Dialga controlled the flow of time, and Palkia controlled space.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Giratina was more violent than its two counterparts and was banished from this world and left to its own devices in the Distortion World. To keep Dialga and Palkia in check, Arceus created the "Lake Trio" of Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf as watchers over the powerful Dragons. The trio also embodied Knowledge, Emotion, and Willpower respectively. They passed down these traits to humans after humans made their appearance in the world. During this creation stage, it is also said that the mysterious Mew appeared. Mew is often seen as the ancestor to all other Pokemon as it contains the DNA of every Pokemon within it.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Red_(game)" target="_blank">Red</a></h3>
        <img src="../images/Trainers/red.jpg" alt="Trainer Red">
        <p>The character of Red is mentioned in passing throughout the history of numerous other notable trainers, but it is usually to denote the fact that he had defeated them in battle at one point or another. At an extremely young age (which is unspecified in the various mediums of the franchise), Red becomes the Indigo League Champion – defeating the entire Elite Four as well as his lifelong rival, Blue.</p><br>

        <h3><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/N" target="_blank">N</a></h3>
        <img src="../images/Trainers/n.jpg" alt="Trainer N">
        <p>N’s story takes place during a tricky time in the Pokémon game series. Video game publisher Game Freak is not generally known for their tightly scripted narratives, but Pokémon Black and White versions contained some of the series' most interesting themes and characters – one of those being N.</p>
        <p>Despite his willingness to speak out against Pokémon battles, N was quite the exceptional trainer and formidable opponent. This villain trained some of the world’s most powerful legendary Pokémon and even managed to defeat the previous Unova League Champion, Alder, ironically making him one of the strongest trainers of all time.</p><br>

        <h3><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Lance" target="_blank">Lance</a></h3>
        <img src="../images/Trainers/lance.png" alt="Trainer Lance">
        <p>Before Blue and Red, Lance was the proverbial top dog in the sphere of Pokémon trainers. His dragon-type beasts dominated aspiring enthusiasts across the land before some talented kids stepped in and stole the crown. However, Lance’s journey did not end there as he continued to work and better himself as a trainer.</p>
        <p>After his defeat at the hands of the young trainers, Lance stepped down from his post as an Indigo League Elite Four member and moved on to the Johto region. Before this decision, he was the world’s resident dragon-type expert and master trainer, and while Lance continued his quest to become the all-time greatest dragon-type trainer, he did so in a new region, with a new crop of creatures to train and battle. After of years and years of hard work and dedication, Lance regained his position, once again – this time as the Pokémon League Champion of the Johto League.</p><br>

        <h3><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Blue_(game)" target="_blank">Blue</a></h3>
        <img src="../images/Trainers/blue.jpg" alt="Trainer Blue">
        <p>In the original generation of the Pokémon franchise, Blue was one of the most talented young trainers to come out of, not only Pallet Town but the entire region of Kanto. In the video game titles, the Pokémon Origins anime, as well as the Pokémon Adventures manga, Blue always managed to find himself one step ahead of his peer, Red.</p>
        <p>Red and Blue became quick rivals when they both received their starter Pokémon at the exact same time from the respected Professor Samuel Oak. After this point, the two young trainers found their paths crossing repeatedly. Blue did manage to become Pokémon League Champion at a young age, but this accomplishment was is short lived as he was quickly beaten by his Red before Oak could even travel to congratulate his own grandson.</p><br>

        <h3><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Cynthia" target="_blank">Cynthia</a></h3>
        <img src="../images/Trainers/Cynthia.jpg" alt="">
        <p>In the video game franchise, Cynthia appears numerous times throughout several titles as a guide of sorts. That being said, she is also quite the intimidating Pokémon trainer. Her signature Pokémon is either Lucario or Garchomp, who not only serve as some of the franchise’s most popular mascots in recent years but also some of the series’ most powerful characters. And when these characters gain the advantage of a mega evolution in later titles, they become even more powerful.</p>
        <p>In the anime episode, Memories are Made of Bliss!, Ash and company watch her respective battle with lifelong trainer Flint. While Flint delivers quite the performance, when all is said and done, Cynthia lives up to her title as League Champion. Cynthia is not only one of the most well-designed characters in the entire franchise, but she is also the first-known woman League champion that gamers will encounter on their respective journey.</p>
